## Abstract
Precipitation has an effect on traffic. Though there may not be a universal correlation (i.e a magical formula) between the two, some correlation exists. Given the time of day, likelihood of water collection, precipitation and the amount of traffic present before the period in question, we use a neural network to predict the effect of precipitation in one time period on traffic in the next. We also present an easy to use GUI for the same.
